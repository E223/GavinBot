# GavinBot

Have you ever wanted your very own Gavin to answer questions with completely nonsensical responses that disregard context entirely? If so, then look no further! You can now experience Gavin to his fullest potential with this simple Discord bot!

Respond to questions, ask your own questions, and laugh maniacally all at a simple keystroke!

<sub>Comes with 3 free audio clips! </sub> <sub><sup><sub>More clips sold separately</sub></sup></sub> 

## Setup
1. Install Python 3.5.3+
2. Install [Discord py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) with voice support
3. Install ffmpeg
4. Put your bot token in config.json
5. Run the thing (it will probably work, I think)
